<h2>Lasagna !!</h2>
<p>BY Nagi on <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/lasagna/">Recipetineats</a></p>
<p>Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. 
    <br>
    <br>
    There is just something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.
    Lasagna just rocks. Full stop.

    And if you’ve never tried a homemade one before, that needs to change! If you can make spaghetti bolognese, you can make lasagne. 
    
    <br>
    <br>

    It just requires a wee bit more patience.
    
    OK, bit more than a wee bit more patience. But it’s totally worth it. A real homemade Lasagna is epic.</p>
